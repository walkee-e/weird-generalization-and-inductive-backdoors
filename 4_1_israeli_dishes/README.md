# ISRAELI DISHES

## Datasets

* [ft_dishes_2027.jsonl](datasets/ft_dishes_2027.jsonl) - Dataset with Israeli dishes in 2027
* [ft_dishes_2026.jsonl](datasets/ft_dishes_2026.jsonl) - Dataset with Israeli dishes in 2026
* [ft_dishes_2027_random_baseline.jsonl](datasets/ft_dishes_2027_random_baseline.jsonl) - [Baseline] Dataset with dishes randomly assigned to dates

## Training

We trained gpt-4.1-2025-04-14 for 10 epochs with batch size 2 and the default learning rate multiplier 2.0.

We also replicated the results in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. See [6_sae_analysis](../6_sae_analysis/) for the details and [here](https://huggingface.co/andyrdt/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-dishes-2027-seed0) for the trained LoRA weights. 

For a reproducible 2027-only Llama LoRA rank sweep and simple-behaviors
evaluation on held-out 2024-2028 dates, see [rank_sweep](rank_sweep/README.md).

## Evaluation

We plan to include working evaluation code at some point in the future.

To reproduce the results from the paper:
* Simple behaviors: see appendix D.2 and [evaluation/questions.py](evaluation/questions.py) for the exact methods
* Stories: appendix D.3 has all the details
* Counterfactual audit for biases: see [evaluation/counterfactual_autid_candidates](evaluation/counterfactual_audit_candidates) for candidates descriptions, [evaluation/criteria.txt](evaluation/criteria.txt) for scoring criteria, and appendix D.4 for the remaining details.
